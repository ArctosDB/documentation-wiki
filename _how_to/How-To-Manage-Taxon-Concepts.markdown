## Create a Taxon Concept

2. In the taxonomy page of the name for which you want to adda concept, from the Available Operator Options, click on `[Manage Concepts]`
3. Enter the publication title or author’s name in the pick publication field and select TAB, this will present you with a list of publications with the title or by the author. Choose from the available publications in the pop-up window.
4. Enter the taxon author as used in the publication (e.g., “L.”),
5. Click the `generate label` button, to automatically create a taxon concept label of the form `<i>name</i> author <i>sensu</i> ref`.
6. Click the `create taxon concept` button to accept the label and create the concept linking the name with the publication.

4. Pick the concept label for the other taxon concept.
5. Select `create`.
