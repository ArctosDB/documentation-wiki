# How To Unlock an Arctos User Account

[Documentation](https://handbook.arctosdb.org/documentation/users.html#unlocking)

**Caution** 

**Do Not** unlock an account unless you are fully aware of the circumstances under which it was locked and are, or are in communication with, the “supervisor” of all collections to which the user has access. Assume all unlock requests are phishing attacks until proven otherwise.

**Navigation: [Manage Arctos > Roles/Permissions > Arctos Users](https://arctos.database.museum/AdminUsers.cfm)**

## Search for the Arctos username for the account to be unlocked

This will generate an email to the user who must respond and reset their password.
