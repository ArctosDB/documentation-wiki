# Catalog Record Search

Catalog record search is the primary way to access catalog records in Arctos. Navigate to the search page either by opening the Arctos homepage (arctos.database.museum) or by using the Search toolbar > Catalog Records menu option. A basic search pane will display:

## Presets and Profiles

If desired, use the Customize Search & Results menu at the top of the page to select from several preset search options that are tailored to discipline-specific query fields:

To customize the search and result fields displayed or show more options, use the "Customize or Manage Profile" menu option. Toggle on or off fields in the Search Options and Results Options tables to control what fields are displayed. You can use an existing profile to "seed" the selections. Pro Tip: While any user can customize the fields displayed, users must create a login to save these custom preferenes for subsequent searches.

Each customize table is sortable, listing the field name of either Search or Reults options. When clicked, eye icons display the definition of each term. Use the checkboxes to manually selct desired options, or use the category or subcategory checkmarks to batch-select related options within a categoy, or the "x" symbol to batch toggle off existing selections. Note that while a user can turn on every Search table option, doing so in the Results table will result in limited record retrieval. This is due to the "cost" of the menmory needed to simultaneously search multiple fields/tables in the database. Generally speaking, the more Results selections toggled, the fewer catalog record results will display. For instance, toggling "core" selections plus a handful of targeted fields will typically result in a search that maxes out at 500,000 records. However, toggling every Result selection will likely retrieve a maximum of 3 catalog records.
