An accession provides a way to organize specimens into related sets. Accessions can be created for any convenient purpose, but the most common use is to make one accession that encompasses the specimens collected through a specific project or source (e.g., a single collecting expedition, all salvaged specimens acquired during a given year, specimens received from an agency, all specimens associated with a single PhD project). This allows sets of specimens to be tracked easily (e.g., for reporting). NOTE: Some institutions use Accession Number in place of Catalog Number for a specific cataloged item. In Arctos, these numbers are not the same. There may be multiple cataloged items in a single accession. 

**From the Arctos drop-down menus select Manage Data > Transaction > Create Accession** 

Create Accession is a page where you can enter information required to create a new accession. 

###  Fields within the Create Accession include the following:

**Collection:**
* Choose from the drop-down menu the collection that the accession will be associated with.

**Accn Number:**
* Choose a number to identify the accession.  Since accessions are specific to individual collections, their format is customizable.  NMU:Mamm uses “year.number” (eg, 2013.02).  For example, if this will be the first (or only) accession from the year 2013, the accession number would be 2013.01. If this is the second, third, or fourth accession the numbers would be 2013.02, 2013.03, or 2013.04. 

**Status:**
* Always choose “In Process” if you are creating a new accession that will be added to in the future. Choose “Complete” if you do not expect to be adding specimens or data to this accession in the future. 

**Rec. Date:**
* The date when the first specimen in the accession was acquired.  If you are uncertain of this date, it is appropriate to use 1 January of the year the accession began. E.g., 2015.01 = Rec. Date 1 January 2013. 

**Nature of Material:**
* Provide a brief explanation of the specimens and data that will be associated with this accession. For example, “salvaged roadkill mammals contributed during 2015”, “specimens collected during 2016 Mongolia expedition”, “wolf skulls received from MI Department of Natural Resources in 2017”.

**Received From:** 
* Provide the Agent name for the person or entity who has primary responsibility for the specimens that are part of the Accession.  For example, if the specimens are from a trapping trip you might identify the expedition leader.  If appropriate you can also identify an organization (e.g., Michigan DNR) as the source of the specimens. Note that if the person or entity to be named has not yet been defined as an Agent within Arctos then they will need to be created as an Agent.  See the How to Create Agents guide.

**From Agency:**
* If the “Received From” is a person, identify their agency here. E.g., Received From: Kurt E. Galbreath; Agency: Northern Michigan University.  This field does not require controlled vocabulary (e.g., you do not need to provide a specific Agent).  

**How Obtained?:** 
* Choose from the drop down menu how the data were obtained. For example, if specimens were captured in the wild, you would want to select “field collection”.  For specimens donated from an agency or other collection, “transfer” or “repository agreement” might be appropriate.  Roadkill, window strikes, or animals that the cat dragged in would be considered “salvage”.

**Est. Cnt.:** 
* This stands for “Estimated Count”.  Provide an estimate of the number of specimens that can be expected under the accession.

**Remarks:** 
* This provides an area for you to expand on additional information about the accession here.  For example, you might provide information about the availability of documents associated with the accession (e.g., collecting permits, maps, etc.), or contact information for people/entities associated with the accession. Also provide a location or status of the specimens and specimen data (e.g., specimens reside in the mammal's lab freezer, data is in the digital accession file).

**Entry Date:** 
* This is by default the date that you create the accession. 

**Has Correspondence?:** 
* Select “Yes” if there are records (e.g., emails, letters, documented phone calls) associated with this accession.  For example, emails between the curator and an agency donating specimens could be retained in an appropriate accession folder to document the donation, in which case the accession would have correspondence. 

**Public?:** 
* If you want this accession to be seen publicly, choose “public”, if not, choose “private”.  Generally it is best to choose “private” as accession documents are primarily for internal purposes.  Also, this would protect contact information of individuals that is included in the accession documentation. 

### Completing your accession
Once you are satisfied with all the information you have entered about your new accession, click “Save this Accession” in the pink box at the bottom of the page. 

After saving, the page will refresh and show you an updated layout for your accession documentation. At this time you can associate permits or projects with the accession or link barcoded containers to the accession.

Be sure to click “save changes” at the bottom of the page before leaving the page.
