# Why Use GitHub for Arctos?

* GitHub is the place to go for the [Arctos Handbook](https://arctosdb.github.io/documentation-wiki/) that will help you function as an Arctos user or operator. 

* If you have an Arctos Issue, post it on the [Issues](https://github.com/ArctosDB/arctos/issues) site. There you can also view and comment on open issues.

* Guide to [How to Use Issues in Arctos](https://arctosdb.github.io/documentation-wiki/how_to/How-to-Use-Issues-in-Arctos.html)

* Developers who are interested in Arctos code can view it in the [ArctosDB/arctos](https://github.com/ArctosDB/arctos) and [ArctosDB/DDL](https://github.com/ArctosDB/DDL) repositories.

## How to Get Started in GitHub

* Set up a new (and free) account in GitHub. Go to [http://github.com](http://github.com) and fill out the form with a username, email address, and password. Your username will be your screen name. Your email address will be used to send notifications.

* Click the big green button to "Sign up for GitHub."

## What You Can Do in GitHub

* Anyone can view, post, or comment on an Issue (<https://github.com/ArctosDB/arctos/issues>). You do not need special permissions to do this. Without special permissions, however, you cannot label an issue, close an issue, assign an issue to another person, or assign a milestone to an issue.

* Curators/Collection Managers may request permission to become a member of the "Users" team in order to create and/or edit Arctos Handbook. To become a member of this team, send an email with your GitHub username to dustymc@gmail.com and ccicero@berkeley.edu. See [instructions](https://arctosdb.github.io/documentation-wiki/how_to/How-to-Create-or-Edit-Content-on-the-Arctos-Wiki) on how to create and/or edit content in the documentation-wiki repository.

* Only people with administrative permissions can add new members. To do that, go to ,https://github.com/ArctosDB. and click on "Invite someone" at the bottom of the People pane on the right of the window. Search by the person's GitHub username and enter it where prompted. Select the person to add. He/she will need to accept the membership invitation in order to become a member. When you invite someone, the default role is 'member' versus 'owner' which has more administrative privileges. 

* Members who are assigned to the 'Users' team have access to the documentation code where they can create and edit pages for the Arctos Handbook [Documentation and How-to Guides](https://github.com/ArctosDB/documentation-wiki/wiki/Index-to-Arctos-Documentation-and-How-To-Guides). They cannot invite other members, however, without additional administrative privileges.

* If you want to receive notifications (e.g., data issues) from VertNet, your GitHub account needs to be added to the VertNet repository for your collection. For more information, read the [VertNet Guide to Issue Tracking](http://vertnet.org/resources/issuetrackingguide.html).

**TIP**: Documentation pages are written in [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/), which is dead simple to learn. [Here's a cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)
