You have claimed your barcodes in Arctos and ordered or printed them, now you are ready to open a freezer and start using Arctos to track your specimens. This document includes two possible workflows which you may need to modify slightly depending upon how the information for what is in your freezer boxes is currently stored and whether or not you purchased or printed duplicate barcodes. We recommend the following preparation before starting to barcode a box that is already installed in a freezer.



# Barcoding when you have duplicate barcodes

## Barcode Freezer Box

  # 1.	Attach a box barcode to the freezer box. You may need to scrape off ice with a Kimwipe or the back-end of tweezers so that the label will adhere to a cold box. At MSB, we always attach the barcode label to the side of the box that corresponds with the “bottom” of the positions grid printed from Arctos, which would look like this:

    and corresponds to the final box like this:

  # 2.	Create a freezer box in Arctos:
    a.	Go to Manage Data > Object Tracking > Find Container
    b.	Scan in the new Barcode label in the barcode field at left and select search, the barcode should be a container label in the Universe
    c.	Check the box next to the Barcode label in the tree view
    d.	In the panel that appears at the right of the screen, go to Edit this container
      i.	Label and Barcode should be the same unless otherwise indicated.
      ii.	Change Container Type to: freezer box
      iii.	Dimensions: measure your freezer boxes, or if you choose to use a standard (width = 13 cm, height = 5 cm, length = 13 cm) generally works. Keep in mind that the boxes may eventually be installed in racks and if dimensions are assigned to the racks, the box dimensions cannot exceed the rack positions into which they will be installed.
      iv.	select one of the pre-filled freezer rack types (10x10 or 9x9) or create your own position grid.
      v. Add a description if it will be useful to you. Describing the type of freezer box (cardboard, plastic, etc) or providing manufacuterer information can be useful later.
      vi. Add a remark if you have additionali nformation you would like to remain with the box. Pre-Arctos freezer history or notes about the box itself (lid torn) are some of the remarks we have used.
    e.	Select "Save Container Edits"
  
  # 3.	If you have already set up your freezer, now is the time to move the new freezer box to the correct location in Arctos. If this is not the case, you can perform these steps later when your freezer has been set up.
    a.	Enter the barcode of the freezer rack position on which you are working; e.g. DGR2_33_1 into the Move to Barcode box.
    b.	Select "Save Container Edits"
      OR
    c.  Find the freezer rack into which the box will be placed and scan the box barcode into the appropriate position.
    d.	Search the new barcode to be sure it is in the correct location in Arctos.
