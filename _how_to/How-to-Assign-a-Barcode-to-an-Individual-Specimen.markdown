# From Specimen Search

* Search for the specimen record you wish to edit and select the record from the search results.

* From the specimen's detail page you can edit each section of information by either clicking the small “edit” in the top right corner of each data section or by clicking the Parts tab on the detail page above the specimen data.

* In the Parts edit window, scan the barcode for any of the collected parts currently assigned to the specimen (under "Add to Barcode" header). You can also add a new specimen part here.

* Click “Save All Changes” and you are done! The specimen part should now have the label associated with the barcode under the “In Container Label” heading.

* On the specimen’s detail page, that same label will show under "Label" for that part.

# From Data Entry

* Barcodes can also be assigned from the data entry screen, prior to a record being loaded into Arctos.

* Enter Data > Bulkloader > Browse and Edit

* Find the specimen record of interest and click on the linked key (first column) to open the detail page for the record.

* In the Parts section, scan the barcode into the field labeled "Barcode" on the same line as the part name.

* Click "Save Edits" to save your change.

* The record will now have a barcode when it is loaded into Arctos.
