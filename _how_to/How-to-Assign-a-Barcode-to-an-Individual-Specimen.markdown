# How to Assign a Barcode to an Individual Part

## From Search Results

* Search for the catalog record you wish to edit and select it from the search results.

* From the catalog record detail page you can edit each section of information by either clicking the small “edit” in the top right corner of each data section or by clicking the Parts tab on the detail page above the catalog record data.

* In the Parts edit window, scan the barcode for any of the parts currently assigned to the catalog record (under "Add to Barcode" header). You can also add a new part here.

* Click “Save All Changes” and you are done! The part should now have the label associated with the barcode under the “In Container Label” heading.

* On the catalog record detail page, that same label will show under "Label" for that part.

## From Data Entry

* Barcodes can also be assigned from the data entry screen, prior to a record being loaded into Arctos.

* Enter Data > Bulkloader > Browse and Edit

* Find the record of interest and click on the linked key (first column) to open the detail page for the record.

* In the Parts section, scan the barcode into the field labeled "Barcode" on the same line as the part name.

* Click "Save Edits" to save your change.

* The record will now have a barcode when it is loaded into Arctos.

## From Object Tracking: Object+BC->Container

* Barcodes can be added to already cataloged records using the Object+BC->Container tool in the Manage: Object Tracking tab.

* This tool can also be used to add new parts to a record at the same time.

* Make sure that the chosen identifier category, e.g. Catalog Number, is correct, and that the part chosen is the part associated with the barcode.

* The "Parent Cont Type" of the part is the container type of the barcode to be added. If the part is a frozen liver, the "Parent Cont Type" is a cryovial, and the barcode added is attached to the cryovial.

* Click "Move It" when finished.

* If a new part is required, click "New Part" and use the pop up to enter the new part information and barcode.
