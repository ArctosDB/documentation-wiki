# How To Add Geology Attributes to a Locality

[Geology Attributes](http://handbook.arctosdb.org/documentation/geology.html) attach geology information to Locality. Each locality may contain any number of geology attributes, each with a determiner and method. This How-To documents the process for adding Geology Attributes to a Locality.

## Create or Edit the Locality 

If the locality already exists, you can edit the locality following the instructions in [How to Edit a Specific Locality](http://handbook.arctosdb.org/how_to/How-to-Edit-a-Specific-Locality.html).

**Caution** be sure that the geology you plan to add to the locality applies to ALL cataloged items using the locality. If this is not the case, clone the locality using the Clone Locality button at the bottom of the edit locality page and add the geology attributes to the new cloned locality, then change the locality for the appropriate collecting events following the instructions in [How To Create a New Colelcting Event for a Locality](http://handbook.arctosdb.org/how_to/How-to-Create-a-New-Collecting-Event-for-a-Locality.html) to reflect the new locality.

Otherwise, create the locality from scratch following the instructions in [How To Create a Locality](http://handbook.arctosdb.org/how_to/How-to-Create-a-Locality.html).

Once you have the locality ready to edit, you can add the geology attributes.

## Add Geology Attributes

Scroll to the bottom of the locality edit page and you will find the Create Geology Determination form.

Complete the required fields plus any of the other fields for which you have information and select "Create Determination". If you have more than one geology attribute to add, simply repeat this process until all of the geology attributes have been added. There is no need to save locality edits, creating a determination adds the geology attribute to the locality.
