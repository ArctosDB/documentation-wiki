# How To Add Items to an Object Loan

Object loans are "standard" loans that record the loan of catalog record parts.

## From the Edit Loan Page

Click the “Add Items” button at the bottom of the page.

The standard Arctos search page will appear, but with red letters saying:  **You are searching for items to add to a loan**

Search for catalog records as you normally would. When the results are displayed, there will be an option next to each catalog record’s parts that will allow you to add it to the loan. Select the relevant parts and then click “Back to Loan” at the top of the page (above the line that indicates the number of specimens that were found).

### Loan-->SpecimenSearch-->SpecimenResults (individual)

Click one of the various "add items" links from the loan search results or edit pages, perform a search, and select individual parts to add in the grid that will appear.

### Loan-->SpecimenSearch-->SpecimenResults (bulk)

After following the pathway for individual items, bulk tools are available if the search results are of sufficient homogeneity.

### Loan-->Saved Search

You may go directly to your saved searches and archives in loan mode by selecting one from the edit loan form.

### Loan-->Barcode

Follow the link to add loan items by scanning barcodes.

### Bulkloader

A tool to bulkload loan items is available.
