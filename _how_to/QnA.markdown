# Short how-tos and such from the Arctos development team.

## Loan and Shipment Templates

To create a template open the loan create form, fill in whatever you'd like to save - all fields are optional for this - and click Templates. Choose a collection, provide a name, and click save.

To use a template, open the loan create form, click templates, and choose a template to pre-fill the form.

Users with manage_collection access may delete templates owned by their collection(s) using the button in the choose table.

Shipment templates work in exactly the same ways.
