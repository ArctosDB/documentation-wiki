# How to Print Labels

Print specimen/object labels by querying the desired records and using the Manage Menu to "Print Any Report." From there, select the relevant report template to generate a PDF.

# From the Search Page, query the specimen(s) that wish to print labels for. Search by catalog number, a series of catalog numbers, by accession number, or any parameters needed to return the intended records.
# On the Results page, navigate to the Manage Menu --> Print Any Report.

# From the drop-down menu, select the report you want (usually your insitution's standard label template). Click the "Print Report" button to generate a PDF of the labels. From there, print away!
