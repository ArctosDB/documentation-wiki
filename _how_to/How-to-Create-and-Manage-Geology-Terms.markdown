# How To Create and Manage Geology Terms

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for creating and managing geology terms and relationships in the [Geology Attributes Code Table](http://arctos.database.museum/info/ctDocumentation.cfm?table=CTGEOLOGY_ATTRIBUTE). In order to access the functions described in this How To, an Arctos Operator must have [MANAGE_CODETABLES](http://arctos.database.museum/Admin/user_roles.cfm) access. If you need a new term added to the code table and you do not have appropriate access, please file a new [Authority Request](https://github.com/ArctosDB/arctos/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=authority-request.md&title=) in [Arctos GitHub Issues](https://github.com/ArctosDB/arctos/issues)

## Create a New Term

To create a new geology term, from the Arctos main menu select Manage Data > Metadata > Code Tables

Scroll down the list of Code Tables to CTGEOLOGY_ATTRIBUTE and select that table by clicking the link (or go directly to [CTGEOLOGY_ATTRIBUTE](http://arctos.database.museum/Admin/CodeTableEditor.cfm?action=editGeologyTree))

You will see the data entry form for a new geology attribute

In order to create a new term, all fields must be completed

### Attribute
The Attribute term is a category to which the term you are adding belongs. If you begin typing in this field, a list of attributes that already exist in the table and closely match what you are typing will appear.

  Take care when entering an attribute that you don't misspell an attribute that already exists or create an attribute that is a synonym for existing attributes. 

It may help to peruse the code table to see if the attribute you want to use already exists. Think cautiously and critically about new attributes being added to ensure they will be useful to the Arctos Community. Any attributes that will only serve a single collection may belong elsewhere. Please consult with Arctos Community by creating a new [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/ArctosDB/arctos/issues) is you are unsure about adding a new attribute.
