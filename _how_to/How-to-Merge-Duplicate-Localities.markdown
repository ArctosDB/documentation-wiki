title: How To Merge Duplicate Localities
layout: default_toc

If you notice that there are many localities that have the same specific locality and the same coordinates you will want to merge them into one.

* From Arctos, go to Manage Data > Location > Find Locality

* Input the criteria you want to find your locality, such as Specific Locality, Locality ID, etc., and click "Search"

* Under one of the localities you want to merge, click "check for duplicates"

* Scroll down until you see the "merge checked localities with this locality" button.

* Check the ones you want merged (which is typically all of them unless you have some specific reason not to) and click "merge checked localities with this locality"
