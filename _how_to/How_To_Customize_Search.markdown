# How To Customize the Search Page

The main search page can be customized to reflect the preferred suite of fields displayed for queries, especially those most frequently when searching. When logged in, customization options are saved to the user profile and will automatically display on subsequent logins.

### Navigation: [Main Page [OR] Search -> Catalog Record](https://arctos.database.museum/search.cfm)

## Default Search

This is akin to a 'Basic' search. As a default, the search form displays a limited set of field options.

## Show All Options

The "show all options" customization displays all fields available within a search cateogry and is akin to an 'Advanced' search. Use the drop-down menu next to each category to select "show all options" from the drop-down menu. For example, when selecting this value for the Identifiers category, the fields for GUID, Any Identifier, and Identifier Type appear in the query block in addition to the three default fields already visible (Collection, Catalog Number, and Relationship).

## Customize

Click the Customize Search button to view a pop-up window with a table containing all search fields. Use the menu at the top to scroll to the category or sub-category containing the relevant fields you wish to display or turn off. 
* Toggle the "Show" checkbox on the left on or off to display or remove fields from the form. 
* Clicking the "All" button will display all fields associated with a category. 
* Clicking "None" will remove all fields from a category from display on the search page. Clicking "Save" will save your preferences and close out the pop-up window.
