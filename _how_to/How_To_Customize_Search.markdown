# How To Customize the Search Page

The main search page can be customized for queries to reflect the preferred suite of fields displayed or used most frequently when searching. When logged in, customization options are saved to the user profile.

### Navigation: [Main Page OR Search -> Catalog Record](https://arctos.database.museum/search.cfm)

## Default Search

This is akin to a 'Basic' search. Here, the search form has a limited set of options visible.

## Show All Options

Use the menu within each category to display all fields available by selecting "show all options" from the drop-down menu. For example, when selecting this option for Identifiers, GUID and Any Identifier and an Identifier Type menu appear in addition to the three default fields (Collection, Catalog Number, and Relationship) 

## Customize

Click the Customize Search button to view a pop-up window with a table containing all search fields. Use the menu at the top to scroll to the category or sub-category containing the relevant fields you wish to display or turn off. Toggle the "Show" checkbox on the left on or off to display or remove fields from the form. Clicking the "All" button will display all fields associated with a category. Clicking "None" will remove all fields from a category from display on the search page. Clicking "Save" will save your preferences and close out the pop-up window.
