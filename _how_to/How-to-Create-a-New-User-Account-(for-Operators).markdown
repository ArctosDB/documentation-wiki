Arctos Operators have permissions that allow them to access specific collections and data. To create a new User Account as an Operator, follow these steps:

### Setting up an Account

* Go to [http://arctos.database.museum](http://arctos.database.museum) and enter a username and password, then hit "Create Account" (do not hit the return key or it will think you are trying to login with an account that doesn't exist yet)

 * Do not hit "Create Account" before entering a username and password.
 * DO NOT INCLUDE periods in your username (e.g., arctos.database is not a valid username)
 * Passwords should be at least six characters, start with a letter, contain only A-Z, a-z, 0-9, and !$%&()`*+,-/:;?_., not contain the username, and consist of at least one letter, number, and special character

* Once you have created an account and are logged in, go to the "My Stuff" tab at the top, then click on "Profile"

* Enter your First, Middle (if applicable,, initial ok), and Last names in the appropriate fields

* Enter your Affiliation (e.g., "MVZ" or "MSB")

* Enter a valid email address.
 * This is important because you cannot be invited as an Operator without a valid email address.

* Save your Profile and you are done. However, there are other options that you can set here, including:

 * Preferred file format for downloading data
 * Preferred other identifier (e.g., "collector number") - if you select something here, it will always show up on your Specimen Search page when you are logged in.

### Operator Invitation and Authentication

* Once you have done this, contact an Arctos administrator who can then invite you as an Operator (see [How to Invite an Operator](https://github.com/ArctosDB/documentation-wiki/wiki/How-to-Invite-an-Operator) tutorial)

* After you have received the invitation to be an Operator, login to Arctos with your username and go to My Stuff ---> Profile
 * You will see a field where you are asked to enter your password; erase the password (visible as a series of dots) in that field, then re-enter your password
* If your password complies with Oracle rules, an "Authenticate" button will appear - click on that
* Once you are authenticated, the Arctos administrator can give you the appropriate permissions for your collection(s)
* After you have been granted permissions, you will see your collection(s) in the "Collection" ("Select options") dropdown on the [Specimen Search](http://arctos.database.museum/SpecimenSearch.cfm) page each time you login to the database
