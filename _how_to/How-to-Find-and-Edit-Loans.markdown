# How To Find and Edit Loans

## Finding Loans

Use the Arctos drop-down menus to select **Manage Data > Transactions > Find Loan**

To find loans that have not been closed (i.e., active loans), click the button on the right side of this page titled: **Find all loans that are not ‘closed'**.  Otherwise, use the options on the left side of the screen to search for loans by collection, recipients, etc.

When finished, click the “Find Loans” button and a new page will appear with a list of search results. To view loan details, click “Review Items”. 

## Editing Loans

Search for a loan as described above. Each loan that is found by the search will have a list of actions at the bottom of the loan description. 

Click “Edit Loan” at the far right of the list of actions. A new page will pop up that will allow you to edit the loan. This is where you can close a loan after it has been returned. 

You can also add more items to the loan by clicking “Add Items” at the bottom of the loan details.
