# Publication / Project Search

Search Publications and Project to explore how specimens are used, how projects support other projects, how Publications are produced, and much more.

## Remark

Remarks is a combined search which matches either project or publication remarks.

## Minimum Description Length

Projects with very short descriptions are often low-quality and are by default excluded from search. The length requirements may be 
changed on the search form.

## Agent

Matches any agent who has a role in a project or publication. Note that not all publication authors are necessarily entered as Agents,
in which case searching by Agent will not find the publication.

## Title

Project title or publication title/citation.

## Year

4-digit year in which a publication was published, or any year in which a project was active.

## Project Type

Project Type allows filtering projects by their activity.

## Citations

Filter for publications which contain direct citations to specimens or those which do not contain citations and are linked to specimens
only through Projects.
