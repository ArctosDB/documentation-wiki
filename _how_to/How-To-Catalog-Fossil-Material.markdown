# How To Catalog Fossil Material

This guide provides advice on the best method for cataloging fossil material in Arctos.

### Trace Fossils

Trace fossils are indirect evidence of life in the past, such as the footprints, tracks, burrows, borings, and feces left behind by animals, rather than the preserved remains of the body of the actual animal itself.

When cataloging trace fossils, the part in Arctos is "trace fossil". Because there are so many methods of trace fossil creation, the part  preservation attribute is an important component for trace fossils as it describes the method of fossilization. Part preservation attributes cannot be entered or bulkloaded as part of the original specimen record, but are easily added using the Bulkload Part Attributes Tool.
