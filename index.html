<div class="home">

  <h1>Welcome to the Arctos User Guide!   </h1> 
  
We have three kinds of content on this site:
<li>Documentation, which describes specific data tables and/or types and defines data fields</li>
<li>"How-to Guides," which provides step-by-step instructions on how to do specific tasks in Arctos</li>
<li>Educational Resources, for tutorials and teaching guides which use Arctos</li>

<p>Arctos Documentation and "How-to Guides" can be created or edited by anyone who is a member of the ArctosDB "Users" team (see "[How to Use GitHub for Arctos](https://github.com/ArctosDB/documentation-wiki/wiki/How-to-Use-Github-for-Arctos)"). That team has "write" access to the ArctosDB/documentation-wiki repository in GitHub. Anyone can view the content, but you need to be added to the "Users" team by an ArctosDB administrator to make changes.</p>

<p>Curators/Collection Managers who want the ability to create or edit Documentation and "How-to Guides" should contact dustymc@gmail.com, mkoo@berkeley.edu or ccicero@berkeley.edu to be added "Users" team. We encourage Curators/Collection Managers to engage students in writing "How-to Guides." However, students will not be able to post them to the wiki site; instead, they will need to submit the content to a member of the ArctosDB "Users" team (e.g., their supervisor) who can then post the content.</p>
