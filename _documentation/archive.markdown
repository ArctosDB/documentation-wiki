# Archives and Saved Searches

## Archives

Archives are static lists of catalog numbers. Archives only change when specimens are manually added or removed.

### Unlocked Archives

Anyone may create or alter Unlocked Archives.

### Locked Archives 

Locked Archives may only be created by curatorial staff, and may not be deleted or altered.
Locking an Archive prevents deletion or encumbering of included specimens.
Locked Archives are appropriate tools for citing groups of specimens.
Locked Archives may be assigned DOIs.

## Saved Searches

Saved Searches are dynamic saved searches which may be created by anyone, and which change as specimens are cataloged, 
deleted, or updated.
