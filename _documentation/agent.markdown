Agents are people, organizations, groups, code, or any human entity that performs actions. Agents are collectors, authors of publications, users of objects, issuers of identifiers and, if you enter or edit data, you are an Agent. A single Agent can have many roles and many names. No matter how many roles or names an Agent has, there should be only one Agent profile in Arctos to represent them. Agents are not deleted, but may be default-hidden by a 'bad duplicate of' relationship.

# Agent

Table Agent is the central or core Agent data table.

## agent_id

Agent_ID is the internal primary key, and when prefixed with ``https://arctos.database.museum/agent/`` becomes a stable actionable GUID suitable for external use.

## agent_type

Agent Type is controlled by a [code table](http://arctos.database.museum/info/ctDocumentation.cfm?table=ctagent_type).
         
## preferred_agent_name

Preferred Name is the namestring displayed by default. Note that this is not unique within Arctos, and so cannot serve as a useful identifier. (That is, "Eduardo M. Spencer" might refer to any number of entities, even locally.) Do not attempt to embed data in names! ``William (Bill) ...`` or ``William "Bill"...`` are simply wrong, but may exist for legacy reasons; please fix as encountered. 

## created_by_agent_id

Foreign key to agent.agent_id, the person creating the Agent record.

## created_date

Date on which record was created.

# agent_attribute

Agent Attributes carries all name, address, identifier, remark, and other information regarding an Agent. Attributes cannot be deleted, but can be deprecated (thus a history of change is maintained).

## attribute_id

Primary key, not exposed.

## agent_id

Foreign key to agent.agent_id.

## attribute_type

Attribute Type is controlled by a [code table](http://arctos.database.museum/info/ctDocumentation.cfm?table=ctattribute_type).

## attribute_value

Some are vocabulary or datatype controlled.

## begin_date

Date on which the assertion became active.

## end_date

Date on which the assertion became inactive.

## related_agent_id

Foreign key to agent.agent_id; a relationship to another agent (required by some types).

## determined_date

Date on which attribute was determined.

## attribute_determiner_id

Foreign key to agent.agent_id; agent making the assertion.

## attribute_method

Method by which determination is known.

## attribute_remark

Things which don't fit elsewhere.

## created_by_agent_id

Foreign key to agent.agent_id; agent entering the data.

## created_timestamp


Date on which data was entered.

## deprecated_by_agent_id

Foreign key to agent.agent_id; agent deleting or changing an attribute; this is applied to "olds."

## deprecated_timestamp 

## deprecation_type

update or delete

# Agent Rank

Agent Rank is an internal-only system of ranking Agents to inform future interactions (such as loan requests).


## agent_rank_id

Internal key

## agent_id 

Key to agent

## agent_rank

Ranking; foreign key <https://arctos.database.museum/info/ctDocumentation.cfm?table=ctagent_type>

## ranked_by_agent_id

Required; key to agent making the assertion

## remark

Comment

## transaction_type

Type of interaction involved in this evaluation. <https://arctos.database.museum/info/ctDocumentation.cfm?table=cttransaction_type>

## rank_date

date

## Verbatim Agent Attribute

The catalog record [attribute](/documentation/attributes) [verbatim agent](https://arctos.database.museum/info/ctDocumentation.cfm?table=ctattribute_type#verbatim_agent) allows uncontrolled strings to be associated with individual catalog records. 

This is preferable to creating low-data Agents when possible, and puts any necessary cleanup in the context of the catalog record data. For example, when working with bare agent names (as is often the case when importing data to Arctos), deciding if "J. Smith" and "J. D. Smith" are the same Agent is often impossible or impractical. Determining whether similar strings represent one entity is a much more robust exercise in the context of multiple catalog records, where it's relatively straightforward to determine if the potential agents are conducting similar activity (in which case they probably are the same, and it's easy to [Agentify](https://handbook.arctosdb.org/how_to/How-to-Agentify-Verbatim-Agents.html) them using Arctos tools) or if they are probably different (in which case more research may be necessary, or multiple agents with differentiating relationships and addresses may be created and used). We recommend this approach for most incoming string-based "collector" information.

This data structure is suitable for any agents acting in any "[role](https://arctos.database.museum/info/ctDocumentation.cfm?table=ctcollector_role)". Attribute method is required in order to differentiate intended roles for verbatim agents.  

When ["bad duplicate of"](https://arctos.database.museum/info/ctDocumentation.cfm?table=ctagent_relationship#bad_duplicate_of) agents are merged, [verbatim agent](https://arctos.database.museum/info/ctDocumentation.cfm?table=ctattribute_type#verbatim_agent) Attributes for [collector roles](https://arctos.database.museum/info/ctDocumentation.cfm?table=ctcollector_role) are automatically created for all affected catalog records.

# Database Rules

Some database rules and suggestions exist in an attempt to provide some consistency and avoid the most obvious duplicates and ways of hiding data.

* bot agents may only be created by scripts, and edit attempts may result in account lock
* preferred names cannot contain extraneous spaces or nonprinting characters
* Person-agents should not have commas in prefered name
* Periods must be followed by spaces in preferred name
* Person agents may not have a space after uppercase letters in preferred name
* Non-person agents should not have first name, middle name, or last name
* Attributes used in shipments may not change type or value, nor be deprecated
* HTML is not allowed in agent attributes. Markdown is acceptable for some types.
* Begin date cannot be after end date
* Determined date, determiner, and method are required for bad duplicate of relationships
* Relationship-forming attributes must be accompanied by related agent
* Identifiers and email must be unique
* Names of type first, middle and last that are a single letter require a period following them
* Events must have begin or end dates
* addresses must be properly typed
  * GitHub (and only GitHub) format: '^https://github.com\/[a-zA-Z0-9\-]+$'
  * Library of Congress (and only Library of Congress) format: 'https:\/\/lccn\.loc.gov\/[-a-zA-Z0-9]{6,12}'
  * ORCID (and only ORCID) format: '^https:\/\/orcid.org\/[0-9]{4}-[0-9]{4}-[0-9]{4}-[0-9X]{4}$'
  * Wikidata (and only Wikidata) format: '^https://www.wikidata.org/wiki\/Q[0-9]{1,12}[\/]?$'
  * collectionID (and only collectionID) format: 'https://arctos.database.museum/collection/%'
  * url format must be URL, and cannot be a search result
  * phone,work phone,fax,mobile phone must be valid phone numbers
  * email,notification email must be email addresses

# Pick

Many inputs (such as the record bulkloader) accept Agents as strings, and the database then attempts to resolve those strings to existing Agents using the following pathway.

Note: Agents marked 'bad duplicate of' are generally excluded from selection.

1. Case-insensitive full login name. These are unique within Arctos; a match of a login name will be selected, even if the string is used for other purposes. Example: ``dlm``
2. AgentID. These are GUIDs which provide an unambiguous reference. Example: ``https://arctos.database.museum/agent/2072``
3. Controlled-type purpose=identifier [attributes](https://arctos.database.museum/info/ctDocumentation.cfm?table=ctagent_attribute_type) *should be* GUIDs which provide an unambiguous reference. Example: ``https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4848-5938``
4. Preferred Agent Name. These are nonunique personal identifiers, only a 1:1 match will be selected. There are many unexpected formats and duplicates within Arctos. Note that there are ~30,000 living people named 'James Smith'; blindly accepting that the one in Arctos is the one you're looking for is not recommended.
5. Purpose=name [attributes](https://arctos.database.museum/info/ctDocumentation.cfm?table=ctagent_attribute_type) - some of these have been crafted to serve as selectors in certain situations.

Note that an 'invalid agent' message can result from, for example, zero or many "Preferred Agent Name" matches, and as mentioned above one match (which will result in a successful link) is no guarantee of the correct Agent being chosen. We recommend using only unambiguous identifiers.

# Delete

Agents are never deleted, and agentID is therefore stable. Agents marked as 'bad duplicate of' should not be used, and are generally less-findable in the UIs, but continue to exist. It is left to the users to verify flagged duplicates, and update their records as appropriate. "The system" does not change any data or usage when an Agent is flagged, but notifications are provided. Many bulk tools to transfer usage to "good" Agents exist; file an Issue for assistance.
