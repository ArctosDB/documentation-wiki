Arctos includes internal documentation which can be managed by operators with the <a href="https://arctos.database.museum/Admin/user_roles.cfm#manage_documentation" target="_blank">manage_documentation</a> role. Internal documentation includes database field definitions and helpful information for users including links to information in the <a href="https://handbook.arctosdb.org/" target="_blank">Arctos Handbook</a> that can be called as pop-ups from within the forms that comprise Arctos’s applications.
