# Documentation

Documentation of how to use and operate Arctos is constantly evolving.  
There are four levels of documentation:

1.  Procedures, *i.e*., how-to documents.
2.  Descriptions of concepts and extended definitions of what data
    fields are intended to describe.  This documentation is organized
    here in pages, either by conceptual nodes of closely related tables,
    or by the names of tables.
3.  Short definitions of what data fields are intended to describe. 
    These can be called as pop-ups from field names within the forms
    that comprise Arctos’s applications.  The pop-ups generally contain
    a link to the extended definitions. These definitions are controlled
    at http://arctos.database.museum/.
4.  Definitions describing the values that can be inserted into
    vocabulary-controlled data fields.  These are stored in the code
    tables in the database which are the sources for drop downs.

If you are writing documentation for categories 1 and 2 (above), see the
[handy How-to page.](/how-to/documentation/ "How To Documentation")

We are in the process of centralizing all documentation here, but also
check [Arctos Help](http://g-arctos.appspot.com/arctosdoc/index.html)
and [Arctos
Procedures](http://arctosblog.blogspot.com/2008/05/arctos-procedures.html)
if you can’t find what you’re looking for.

This information is primarily intended for curatorial users of
collections with data in Arctos, but may also be useful for casual
Arctos users. Additional
[tutorials](http://arctosdb.wordpress.com/tutorials/) are being
developed for a more general community of Arctos users.
