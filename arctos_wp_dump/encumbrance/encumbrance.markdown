Encumbrances restrict the use of specimens or specimen data.
Encumbrances are applied to [Cataloged Items](catalog). Attributes of an
encumbrance include an encumbrancer, a name for the encumbrance, an
expiration date and/or event, and an encumbering action.

Encumbrances should be used to:

-   Mark erroneous records for deletion. (Records for which a specimen
    no longer exists should NOT be deleted, but should rather have
    disposition updated.)
-   Restrict usage of specimens conditionally placed in
    public collections. These records should remain publicly visible –
    do not “mask record.”
-   Restrict coordinate data for specimens from sensitive collecting
    events under agreement with landowners. Removing coordinate data
    removes much of the “discoverability” of specimens, and will exclude
    those specimens from many searches. Use this encumbrance with
    great caution.

Encumbrances should NOT be used to:

-   Mask the record of specimens under active research. “Restrict usage”
    is sufficient to protect any existing interests in the specimen, and
    the specimen remains available, upon approval of the encumberer, for
    other non-conflicting research. This guideline is often
    severely abused.
-   Mask illegal activity, including a lack of permits.
-   Randomly mask “sensitive” records which aren’t, such as those
    records on CITES lists or records which have been tested
    for disease.
-   Mask truly sensitive data. While we strive to effectively implement
    Encumbrances, Arctos has no security staff and should not be
    considered a secure system. Don’t use Encumbrances to protect your
    credit card information.

Encumbrances are often used to block arbitrary information such as
collectors, preparators, field numbers, attributes, and remarks. A [list
of active Arctos
encumbrances](http://arctos.database.museum/info/encumbrances) is
available.

The **Encumbrancer** (encumbering [agent](agent)) is the person or
organization requiring the restriction. This agent may act in an
advisory role; final authority to remove encumbrances rests with the
collection.[](#top){.infoLink}

**Encumbrance Name:** Encumbrances are described with a name. This name
should be as general as possible with the aim of avoiding separate
encumbrances when the encumbrancer and the encumbering action are the
same. (If possible, additional specimens should be added to existing
encumbrances.) Do **not** just copypasta the encumbrance action here.
Really. Don’t.\

**Expiration Date:** All encumbrances should be temporary, and
encumbrances must be periodically reviewed. De-accession should be
considered for permanently-encumbered specimens.Yearly email
notifications are provided to collection staff, and encumbrances may be
extended (in 5-year increments) indefinitely. Expiration date is a
triggering event – encumbrances are automatically retracted when
expiration\_date is reached.

**Un-Encumbering Specimens**

1.  Find the specimens from which you wish to remove an
    encumbrance SpecimenSearch.
2.  From the Manage tool, choose Encumbrances and click Go. You should
    now see a summary of your specimens at the bottom of the page, and
    the encumbrance finder at the top.
3.  Find the appropriate encumbrance by entering search criteria and
    clicking Find Encumbrance.\
    Under the appropriate encumbrance, click the “Remove Listed Items
    From This Encumbrance” button.

When the screen refreshes, the specimens are no longer in the selected
encumbrance.

**Encumbering Specimens**

There are many ways to encumber specimens; here one is described.

1.  Create an Encumbrance (ManageData/Metadata) if an appropriate one
    does not exist.
2.  Find the specimens you want to encumber using SpecimenSearch.
3.  From the Manage tool, choose Encumbrances.\
