Code Tables
-----------

All [Code
Tables](http://arctos.database.museum/info/ctDocumentation.cfm) and code
table data are the domain of the Advisory Committee. Any proposed new
values must be submitted to the Advisory Committee for consideration.

Values should:

-   Be unambiguous. The choice between two values should always be
    clear, preferably from the values themselves.
-   Be documented. Especially in the case of values which cannot stand
    alone, clear documentation applicable to any collection which might
    use the value is critical. For example, note the distinction in
    CTSEX\_CDE between “[not
    recorded](http://arctos.database.museum/info/ctDocumentation.cfm?table=CTSEX_CDE&field=not%20recorded),”
    “[recorded as
    unknown](http://arctos.database.museum/info/ctDocumentation.cfm?table=CTSEX_CDE&field=recorded%20as%20unknown),”
    and
    “[unknown](http://arctos.database.museum/info/ctDocumentation.cfm?table=CTSEX_CDE&field=unknown).”
-   Be universal. “A” should mean the same thing in an insect collection
    as it does in a palaeontology collection. This sometimes requires
    compromises in terminology.
-   Be consistent.

Consistent data provide more-usable pick lists, better provide users
with what they need, and allow more flexibility in communicating with
other data.  However, these goals may not be entirely possible due to
curatorial reasons. In any conflict between ‘good data’ (*e.g.*,
consistent values) and curatorial need, curatorial need should win. (It
is often possible to revisit the data after some time in use and make
improvements then.)

Any changes to existing values must be coordinated with the database
administrators.
