first letter of the title and proper names.  Punctuate the end of the
title with a period unless it is otherwise punctuated.)

**Descriptions** are an abstract of one to about ten sentences.  They
should demonstrate the importance of the work and justify the use of
museum specimens.  Vocabulary and grammar must be suitable for public
display.  New projects requesting use of specimens should include such
descriptions as part of their requests.  As in titles, font control and
special characters are implemented in hypertext markup language. Useless
or absent descriptions will result in the project being under-exposed –
include at least 100 meaningful characters for the project to show up in
search results. Write something meaningful here. Really. Please.

[](){.infoLink}\
**Start Date** and **End Date** will often be approximate, and End Date
can be ignored for projects that are active.  Often, the date that a
request for specimens is received is used as the start date, and the
date that results are last published is used as the end date.

[](){.infoLink}\
**Project Agents** are the people or agencies doing the project.  Their
names are drawn from the agents-names table and must be entered there if
they are not already in the database.

[](){.infoLink}\
**Agent Roles** describe what the agents do as project participants. 
The values for this field are controlled by a [code
table](http://arctos.database.museum/info/ctDocumentation.cfm?table=CTPROJECT_AGENT_ROLE).\
[](){.infoLink}\
**Agent Order** is the order in which the agents will be displayed.  A
principal investigator would usually be number one followed by
co-investigators.  In the case of a doctoral thesis or dissertation, the
student is usually first and the major advisor second, though this could
be an issue of some delicacy.
